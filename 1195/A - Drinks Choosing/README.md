Or may be the story was more complicated?</p><p>There are $$$n$$$ students living in a building, and for each of them the favorite drink $$$a_i$$$ is known. So you know $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le k$$$) is the type of the favorite drink of the $$$i$$$-th student. The drink types are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$.</p><p>There are infinite number of drink sets. Each set consists of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">exactly two</span> portions of the same drink. In other words, there are $$$k$$$ types of drink sets, the $$$j$$$-th type contains two portions of the drink $$$j$$$. The available number of sets of each of the $$$k$$$ types is infinite.</p><p>You know that students will receive the minimum possible number of sets to give all students exactly one drink. Obviously, the number of sets will be exactly $$$\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$$$, where $$$\lceil x \rceil$$$ is $$$x$$$ rounded up.</p><p>After students receive the sets, they will distribute their portions by their choice: each student will get exactly one portion. Note, that if $$$n$$$ is odd then one portion will remain unused and the students' teacher will drink it.</p><p>What is the maximum number of students that can get their favorite drink if $$$\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$$$ sets will be chosen optimally and students will distribute portions between themselves optimally?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, k \le 1\,000$$$) — the number of students in the building and the number of different drinks.</p><p>The next $$$n$$$ lines contain student's favorite drinks. The $$$i$$$-th line contains a single integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ — the type of the favorite drink of the $$$i$$$-th student.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>Print exactly one integer — the maximum number of students that can get a favorite drink.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Examples</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id006789520719089314" id="id007346718158414782" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id006789520719089314">5 3

This way all students except the second one will get their favorite drinks.</p><p>Another possible answer is sets with drinks $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$. In this case the portions will be $$$1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3$$$. Then all the students except one will gain their favorite drinks. The only student that will not gain the favorite drink will be a student with $$$a_i = 1$$$ (i.e. the first, the third or the fourth).</p></div>
