Since winters in your region can be very cold you need to decide how to heat rooms in your house.</p><p>Your house has $$$n$$$ rooms. In the $$$i$$$-th room you can install at most $$$c_i$$$ heating radiators. Each radiator can have several sections, but the cost of the radiator with $$$k$$$ sections is equal to $$$k^2$$$ burles.</p><p>Since rooms can have different sizes, you calculated that you need at least $$$sum_i$$$ sections in total in the $$$i$$$-th room. </p><p>For each room calculate the minimum cost to install at most $$$c_i$$$ radiators with total number of sections not less than $$$sum_i$$$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$) — the number of rooms.</p><p>Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains the description of some room.

The cost of the radiator is equal to $$$(10^4)^2 = 10^8$$$.</p><p>In the second room, you can install up to $$$10^4$$$ radiators, but since you need only one section in total, it's optimal to buy one radiator with one section.</p><p>In the third room, there $$$7$$$ variants to install radiators: $$$[6, 0]$$$, $$$[5, 1]$$$, $$$[4, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 3]$$$, $$$[2, 4]$$$, $$$[1, 5]$$$, $$$[0, 6]$$$. The optimal variant is $$$[3, 3]$$$ and it costs $$$3^2+ 3^2 = 18$$$.</p></div>
